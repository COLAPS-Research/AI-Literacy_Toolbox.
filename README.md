The AI Literacy Toolbox is a comprehensive web platform designed to empower students, educators, and enthusiasts with the knowledge and skills to understand, evaluate, and effectively use Artificial Intelligence. Developed as a project at the University of Duisburg-Essen, this application combines educational content with interactive tools in a fully containerized, easy-to-deploy package.

Our mission is to close the AI knowledge gap by providing a collaborative platform where the community can learn and contribute.

Core Features

Educational Content: Interactive modules and resources explaining key AI concepts, ethics, and applications.

Interactive Tools: A curated collection of games and tools designed to teach AI principles like pattern recognition and machine learning in a hands-on way.

Community Submissions: A simple and secure form for users to submit their own AI literacy tools, helping the platform grow.

Email Notifications: An automated email system to confirm successful tool submissions.

Fully Containerized: The entire stack (Frontend, Backend, Database) is managed with Docker and Docker Compose for one-command setup and deployment.

Secure API: A backend built with Node.js and Express, designed to run securely under a specific URL path for multi-app environments.

Dynamic Search: Client-side search functionality to quickly find content across the site.
